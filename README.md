# min-BARETO
min-BARETO is a lightweight version of BAsic REporting TOol (BARETO). It uses a YAML file to generate a report by merging the vulnerabilities templates with the selected report template.

## Files

The YAML project file is generated by the user and describes the different fields to be included in the final document.

In the _vulnerabilities_ folder you can find the different templates used to describe the fields of each vulnerability.

In the _reports_ folder it could be find the different templates in __.docx__ format that will be joined with the project file and the different vulnerability templates to generate the final report.

## TODO
 
- [ ] Add vulnerabilities tempates
- [ ] Add more report templates with different formats
